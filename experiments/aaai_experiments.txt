** Experiment Sets **
camready1.yml: Rerun everything for the camera ready.
camready1_181105

camready1_1.yml: Same, but pruning features such that all denotations are > 0. We want to compare this to previous
                 experiment without this type of pruning.

camready2: Rerun again but this time using timestamps for experiment folder names, otherwise things are confused.
           This one is without the pruning of denotations > 0.

camready_clear_T_k18.yml: only clear(x) in blocks, with theory T and a bound of k=18, to see if the IJCAI paper
feature set can be generated.
    camready_clear_T_k18_181106: with pruning denotations always > 0
